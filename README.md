## Getting started

This library is available on Maven Central, add the following dependency:

```gradle
implementation 'io.github.pelmenstar1:rangeCalendar:0.9.2'
```

Define `RangeCalendarView` in your XML layout:

```xml

<io.github.pelmenstar1.RangeCalendarView android:id="@+id/picker"
    android:layout_width="match_parent" android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
```

Get notified when the date or range are selected:
<br/>
*(In example, the methods return true to mark that selection is valid. [More about it](#listener))*

```kotlin
calendar.onSelectionListener = object : RangeCalendarView.OnSelectionListener {
    override fun onSelectionCleared() {
    }

    override fun onDaySelected(year: Int, month: Int, day: Int): Boolean {
        return true
    }

    override fun onWeekSelected(
        weekIndex: Int,
        startYear: Int,
        startMonth: Int,
        startDay: Int,
        endYear: Int,
        endMonth: Int,
        endDay: Int
    ): Boolean {
        return true
    }

    override fun onMonthSelected(year: Int, month: Int): Boolean {
        return true
    }

    override fun onCustomRangeSelected(
        startYear: Int,
        startMonth: Int,
        startDay: Int,
        endYear: Int,
        endMonth: Int,
        endDay: Int
    ): Boolean {
        return true
    }
}

```

## Demo

[Try it yourself](https://github.com/pelmenstar1/RangeCalendar/releases/download/0.9.2/demo.apk)

## Selection view

It's a view that will be shown when user selects date or range. <br/>
**Visual example:**

<img src="./art/example-selection-view.gif" width="400px"/>

To keep information on that view relevant,
use `getOnSelectionListener()/setOnSelectionListener()` <br/>

- `getSelectionView()/setSelectionView()` to assign or get the view.
- `getSelectionViewTransitionDuration()/setSelectionViewTransitionDuration()` to assign or get
  duration (in milliseconds) of selection view show/hide animation
- `getSelectionViewTransitionInterpolator()/setSelectionViewTransitionInterpolator()` to assign or
  get time interpolator of selection show/hide animation
- `getSelectionViewLayoutParams()/getSelectionViewLayoutParams()` to assign or get layout params for
  the view
- `hasSelectionViewClearButton()/setHasSelectionViewClearButton()` to get or set whether on
  selection (if selection view is not null) 'next month' button will become 'clear selection'
  button.

## Minimum and maximum dates

- `getMinDate()/getMaxDate()` to get minimum and maximum dates respectively.
- `setMinDate()/setMaxDate()` to set minimum and maximum dates respectively.

## Listener

Use `getOnSelectionListener()/setOnSelectionListener()` to get or set the listener. In all methods,
month and day of month are 1-based.

- `onSelectionCleared()` fires when selection is cleared.
- `onDaySelected(year, month, day)` fires when day is selected.
- onWeekSelected(weekIndex, startYear, startMonth, startDay, endYear, endMonth, endDay) fires when
  week is selected.
    - weekIndex - index of selected week, 0-based
- onMonthSelected(year, month) fires when month is selected.
- onCustomRangeSelected(startYear, startMonth, startDay, endYear, endMonth, endDay) fires when
  custom range is selected

The methods (except `onSelectionCleared()`) should return boolean that indicate whether the
selection is valid or not.

## Animations

They are enabled by default (currently they cannot be disabled).

- `getCommonAnimationDuration()/setCommonAnimationDuration()` to get or set duration (in
  milliseconds) of common animations
- `getCommonAnimationInterpolator()/setCommonAnimationInterpolator()` to get or set time
  interpolator of common animations. By default, it's linear.
- `getHoverAnimationDuration()/setHoverAnimationDuration()` to get or set duration (in milliseconds)
  of hover animation
- `getHoverAnimationInterpolator()/setHoverAnimationInterpolator()` to get or set time interpolator
  of hover animation. By default, it's linear.

## Changing page of calendar

- `moveToPreviousMonth(withAnimation=true)` to slide to previous month (if it's possible) with
  animation or not (it's controlled by `withAnimation` flag)
- `moveToNextMonth(withAnimation=true)` to slide to next month (if it's possible) with animation or
  not (it's controlled by `withAnimation` flag)
- `setYearAndMonth(year, month, withAnimation=true)` to slide to given year & month with animation
  or not (it's controlled by `withAnimation` flag). If given page is out of enabled range, selected
  page will remain the same

## Managing selection through the code

- `selectDay()` to select a day. If the day is out of enabled range, it won't be selected and
  listeners won't be fired.
- `selectWeek(year, month, weekIndex)` to select a week.
    - year should be in range of [1970; 32767]
    - month is 1-based
    - weekIndex is 0-based
- `selectMonth(year, month)` to select a month.
    - year should be in range of [1970; 32767]
    - month is 1-based
- `selectCustom(LocalDate startDate, LocalDate endDate)` to select custom range. The range should
  fit in single month, otherwise the exception will be thrown.
- `clearSelection()` to clear selection.

## Movement

- Double-touch to select a week
- Long-press to start selecting a custom range.
- Click on month information view (on top center) to select month

## Other

- `allowedSelectionTypes()` returns special object that manages allowed types of selection. Example:

    ```java
    calendar.allowedSelectionTypes().month(false).customRange(true)
    ```

  By code above, we disabled month and custom range selection. If selection type become disabled,
  it'll be automatically cleared.

    - `cell(boolean)` sets whether cell can be selected
    - `week(boolean)` sets whether week can be selected
    - `month(boolean)` sets whether month can be selected
    - `customRange(boolean)` sets whether custom range can be selected

  By default all types of selection are allowed.

- `getVibrateOnSelectingCustomRange()/setVibrateOnSelectingCustomRange()` to get or set whether the
  device should vibrate on start of selecting custom range.
- `getClickOnCellSelectionBehavior()/setClickOnCellSelectionBehavior()` to get or set behaviour when
  user (note, not from code) clicks on already selected cell. Use constants
  from `ClickOnCellSelectionBehavior`:
    - `NONE` - nothing happens
    - `CLEAR` - selection clears

                <li>shortName (WeekdayType.SHORT) - weekdays will look like Mob, Tue, Wed. </li>
                <li>narrowName (WeekdayType.NARROW) - weekdays will look like M, T, W,. </li>

        Gets or sets the way of determining bounds of selection. 
        It only matters when selection fill is gradient-like.
        It can be one of these values:
        <ul>
          <li>grid - gradient distribution is limited to grid of the calendar.</li>
          <li>shape - gradient distribution is limited to selection shape.</li>
