## Getting started

This library is available on Jitpack.

Add it in your root build.gradle:

```gradle
allprojects {
  repositories {
    ...
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
}
```

Add the dependency:

```gradle
implementation 'com.github.pelmenstar1:RangeCalendar:0.9.4'
```

Define `RangeCalendarView` in your XML layout:

```xml
<com.github.pelmenstar1.rangecalendar.RangeCalendarView
    android:id="@+id/picker"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
```

Get notified when the date or range are selected:
<br/>

```kotlin
onSelectionListener = object : RangeCalendarView.OnSelectionListener {
    override fun onSelectionCleared() {
    }

    override fun onSelection(
        startYear: Int,
        startMonth: Int,
        startDay: Int,
        endYear: Int,
        endMonth: Int,
        endDay: Int
    ) {
    }
}
```

## Demo

[Try it yourself](https://github.com/pelmenstar1/RangeCalendar/releases/download/0.9.4/demo.apk)

## Selection view

It's a view that will be shown when user selects date or range. <br/>
**Visual example:**

<img src="./art/example-selection-view.gif" width="400px"/>

To keep information on that view relevant, use `getOnSelectionListener()/setOnSelectionListener()` <br/>

- `getSelectionView()/setSelectionView()` to assign or get the view.
- `getSelectionViewTransitionDuration()/setSelectionViewTransitionDuration()` to assign or get duration (in
  milliseconds) of selection view show/hide animation
- `getSelectionViewTransitionInterpolator()/setSelectionViewTransitionInterpolator()` to assign or get time interpolator
  of selection show/hide animation
- `getSelectionViewLayoutParams()/getSelectionViewLayoutParams()` to assign or get layout params for the view
- `hasSelectionViewClearButton()/setHasSelectionViewClearButton()` to get or set whether on selection (if selection view
  is not null) 'next month' button will become 'clear selection' button.

## Minimum and maximum dates

- `getMinDate()/getMaxDate()` to get minimum and maximum dates respectively.
- `setMinDate()/setMaxDate()` to set minimum and maximum dates respectively.

## Listener

Use `getOnSelectionListener()/setOnSelectionListener()` to get or set the listener. In all methods, month and day of
month are 1-based.

- `onSelectionCleared()` fires when selection is cleared.
- `onSelection(startYear, startMonth, startDay, endYear, endMonth, endDay)` fires on selection. Start and end dates are inclusive.

## Animations

They are enabled by default (currently they cannot be disabled).

- `getCommonAnimationDuration()/setCommonAnimationDuration()` to get or set duration (in milliseconds) of common
  animations
- `getCommonAnimationInterpolator()/setCommonAnimationInterpolator()` to get or set time interpolator of common
  animations. By default, it's linear.
- `getHoverAnimationDuration()/setHoverAnimationDuration()` to get or set duration (in milliseconds)
  of hover animation
- `getHoverAnimationInterpolator()/setHoverAnimationInterpolator()` to get or set time interpolator of hover animation.
  By default, it's linear.
- `getCellAnimationType()/setCellAnimationType()` to get or set type of animation for cells. See `CellAnimationType`.

## Changing page of calendar

- `moveToPreviousMonth(withAnimation=true)` to slide to previous month (if it's possible) with animation or not (it's
  controlled by `withAnimation` flag)
- `moveToNextMonth(withAnimation=true)` to slide to next month (if it's possible) with animation or not (it's controlled
  by `withAnimation` flag)
- `setYearAndMonth(year, month, withAnimation=true)` to slide to given year & month with animation or not (it's
  controlled by `withAnimation` flag). If given page is out of enabled range, selected page will remain the same

## Custom selection manager

If you want to draw the selection in other way than the library does, you can implement `SelectionManager` on your own.
There are two main abstractions in selection management:

- 'selection state' - saves type of selection, its range (rangeStart and rangeEnd) and other data required to draw it on
  canvas.
- 'selection manager' - responsible for creating selection state and transitions between them. The manager is expected to be stateless, except caching instances of `renderer` and `transitionController`
- 'selection renderer' - responsible for rendering the selection state on `Canvas`. The implementation is not expected to be stateful, but it's acceptable to cache some information in order to make the rendering faster.
- 'selection transition controller' - responsible for mutating `SelectionState.Transition` internal data to make a transition.

There's a description of methods of `SelectionManager` and what they are expected to do:

- `createState(rangeStart, rangeEnd, measureManager)` - creates a **new** selection state. Note that, rangeEnd is **inclusive**. measureManager can be used to determine bounds of a cell and other info.
- `updateConfiguration(state, measureManager)` - updates internal measurements and computation based on measureManager results
  of both previousState and currentState. Change of measureManager result means that cells might be moved or resized.
- `createTransition(previousState, currentState, measureManager, options)` - creates a transitive state between previousState and currentState

Selection renderer is responsible for drawing simple selection state or transitive state, that is created to save information about transition between two selection states. When selection is to be drawn, the canvas' matrix is translated in such way that coordinates will be relative to the grid's leftmost point on top.

To use the custom implementation of `SelectionManager` is the calendar view,
use `RangeCalendarView.setSelectionManager()`
To use default implementation, pass `null` to setSelectionManager().

There's also a `CellMeasureManager` class which returns position and size of specified cell. It's passed as an argument
to some methods of `SelectionManager`. Although it's a public interface and it can be implemented on your own, you
cannot use your implementation in a calendar view. It's implemented inside the library.

## Gestures

The library allows to customize detecting gestures based on the `MotionEvent`s.
You can do this by specifying custom implementation of `RangeCalendarGestureDetectorFactory` that creates your implementation of `RangeCalendarGestureDetector`

```kotlin
class DetectorImpl : RangeCalendarGestureDetector() {
    override fun processEvent(event: MotionEvent): Boolean {
        // ... your code
    }
}

object DetectorImplFactory : RangeCalendarGestureDetectorFactory<DetectorImpl> {
    val detectorClass: Class<DetectorImpl>
        get() = DetectorImpl::class.java

    override fun create(): DetectorImpl {
        return DetectorImpl()
    }
}

rangeCalendar.gestureDetectorFactory = DetectorImplFactory
```

The gesture detection is based on detecting specific gesture __types__ that can be defined for your implementation:
```kotlin
class MyTypeConfiguration(val configValue: Float)

object DetectorImplGestureTypes {
  // Ordinal number is the thing that defines the gesture type. It's used for equality, hashing and comparing.
  val myType = RangeCalendarGestureType<MyTypeConfiguration>(ordinal = 0, displayName = "myType")
}
```

Each gesture type is associated with some type of options that may be needed in your implementation.

To create the configuration you can use builder method:
```kotlin
rangeCalendar.gestureConfiguration = RangeCalendarGestureConfiguration {
    enabledGestureTypes = setOf(DetectorImplGestureTypes.myType)

    gestureTypeOptions {
        put(DetectorImplGestureTypes.myType, MyTypeConfiguration(configValue = 1f))
    }
}
```

The library provides default gesture detector that detects these gestures:
- single tap to select a cell (`RangeCalendarDefaultGestureTypes.singleTapCell`)
- double tap to select a week (`RangeCalendarDefaultGestureTypes.doubleTapWeek`)
- long press to start selecting custom range and then move **one** pointer to specify the range (`RangeCalendarDefaultGestureTypes.longPressRange`)
- long press to start selecting custom range and then move **two** pointers to specify the range (`RangeCalendarDefaultGestureTypes.longPressTwoPointersRange`)
- horizontal pinch to select week (`RangeCalendarDefaultGestureTypes.horizontalPinchWeek`)
- diagonal pinch to select month (`RangeCalendarDefaultGestureTypes.diagonalPinchMonth`)

The configuration of gesture detector can be changed when the detector is default:
```kotlin
rangeCalendar.gestureConfiguration = RangeCalendarGestureConfiguration {
    enabledGestureTypes {
        doubleTapWeek()
        horizontalPinchWeek()
        // other types are disabled
    }
    
    gestureTypeOptions {
        // horizontalPinchWeek is associated with PinchConfiguration
        put(
            RangeCalendarDefaultGestureTypes.horizontalPinchWeek,
            PinchConfiguration(
                // 10 degrees
                angleDeviation = 10f * (180f / PI.toFloat()),
                minDistance = Distance.Relative(fraction = 0.5f, anchor = Distance.RelativeAnchor.WIDTH)
            )
        )
    }
}
```

## Time zone

- `getTimeZone()/setTimeZone()` to get or set calendar's time zone. By default, it's default system time
  zone (`TimeZone.getDefault()`). Calendar's time zone affects to "today" cell recognition. When new time zone is set, "
  today" cell is updated.

## Observing date and time-zone changes

This can be done manually by registering an `BroadcastReceiver` and updating time zone via `setTimeZone()` or notifying about today's date change via `notifyTodayChanged()`.
Or `RangeCalendarConfigObserver` can be used that, basically, does the same thing. The class is also lifecycle-aware.
Example:
```kotlin
val observer = RangeCalendarConfigObserver(rangeCalendar).apply {
    observeDateChanges = false // if we don't want rangeCalendar to be notified about these changes.
    observeTimeZoneChanges = true // by default, it's true. But can also be disabled.
}
observer.setLifecycle(lifecycle) // If we want to unregister the observer on destroy.
observer.register() // The observer should be registered manually.
```

## Weekday names

By default, the calendar will use localized weekdays in 'short' format. The format of localized weekdays can be changed via `weekdayType`. Currently there's only two options:

- `WeekdayType.SHORT`. If user locale is English, weekdays will look like: Mo, Tu, We, Th, Fr, Sa, Su
- `WeekdayType.NARROW`. If user locale is English, weekdays will look like: M, T, W, T, F, S, S.

If you want to change weekdays, it can be done via `weekdays`:

```kotlin
rangeCalendarView.weekdays = arrayOf("0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6")
```

If you want back to using localized weekdays, pass null to `weekdays`.

## The first day of the week

By default, information about the first day of the week is extracted from current locale's data. If the locale is changed, the first day of the week is re-computed.

If you want to use custom the first day of the week, use can change it via `firstDayOfWeek` or `intFirstDayOfWeek`:
```kotlin
rangeCalendarView.firstDayOfWeek = java.time.DayOfWeek.SATURDAY

// or

rangeCalendarView.intFirstDayOfWeek = java.util.Calendar.SATURDAY
```

Changing the first day of the week via these properties makes the first day of the week fixed, i.e it will be no longer updated on configuration updates. It also clears the selection if present. **NOTE: if values of the first day of the week on the time of saving view's state and restoring it are different, the saved selection is not restored.**

## Info textview

Info textview is in red rectangle:

<img src="art/info_text_view.png" alt="Info textview" width="400"/>

Information about year and month of selected page is on that textview. The text can be changed by specifying custom `infoFormatter`:

```kotlin
rangeCalendar.infoFormatter = object : RangeCalendarView.InfoFormatter {
    override fun format(year: Int, month: Int): CharSequence {
        return "Year: $year Month: $month"
    }
}
```

If your implementation depends on current configuration's locale, use `RangeCalendarView.LocalizedInfoFormatter`.

If you want to use default localized implementation with custom datetime pattern, use `infoPattern`. **Note**: by default, specified format will be additionally processed by `android.text.format.DateFormat.getBestDateTimePattern` to find most suitable pattern for current locale. If it's undesirable, set `useBestPatternForInfoPattern` to `false`.

`useBestPatternForInfoPattern` property depends on `android.text.format.DateFormat.getBestDateTimePattern` that is available from API level 18. On older versions, this property changes nothing.

You can directly access info textview via `infoTextView` property.

## Other

- `getVibrateOnSelectingCustomRange()/setVibrateOnSelectingCustomRange()` to get or set whether the device should
  vibrate on start of selecting custom range.
- `getClickOnCellSelectionBehavior()/setClickOnCellSelectionBehavior()` to get or set behaviour when user (note, not
  from code) clicks on already selected cell. Use constants from `ClickOnCellSelectionBehavior`:
    - `NONE` - nothing happens
    - `CLEAR` - selection clears
